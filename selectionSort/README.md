# Selection Sort

This is a C++ program that implements the selection sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.


## Algorithm

The program uses the following steps to sort the array using the selection sort algorithm:

1. Find the minimum element in the unsorted portion of the array.
2. Swap it with the first unsorted element.
3. Repeat the process for the remaining unsorted portion of the array.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter 5 integers in random order:
5 2 8 1 3
UNSORT ARRAY:
5 2 8 1 3
SORT ARRAY:
1 2 3 5 8
