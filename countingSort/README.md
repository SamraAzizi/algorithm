# Counting Sort Algorithm

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of the Counting Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order. The program has been modified to accommodate a specified range of values (0-65) for the input integers.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this program, you need:

- A C++ compiler such as GCC or Clang.
- Visual Studio Code (VSCode) or any other code editor of your choice with C++ support.

### Installation

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).

## Usage

1. Open the `main.cpp` file.
2. Modify the `myarray` array to input your desired set of integers within the specified range (0-65).
3. Save the changes.
4. Compile and run the program.

Alternatively, you can use the provided `myarray` array to test the program with pre-defined integers.

## Running the Program

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.cpp` file.
3. Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, with GCC:


4. Run the compiled executable:


5. Follow the prompts to input the size of the array and the integers within the specified range.
6. The program will output the original array, followed by the sorted array using the Counting Sort algorithm.
