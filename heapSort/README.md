# Heap Sort

This is a C++ program that implements the heap sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.


## Algorithm

The program uses the following steps to sort the array using the heap sort algorithm:

1. Build a max heap from the input array.
2. Extract the maximum element from the heap and move it to the end of the array.
3. Repeat the process for the remaining elements until the array is sorted.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter the size of the array:
5
Enter 5 integers in any order:
5 2 8 1 3
Before Sorting:
5 2 8 1 3

After Sorting:
1 2 3 5 8
