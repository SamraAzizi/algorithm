# Bubble Sort Algorithm

This C++ program demonstrates the implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.

## Getting Started

## Usage

1. Open the `main.cpp` file.
2. Modify the `myarray` array to input your desired set of integers.
3. Save the changes.
4. Compile and run the program.

Alternatively, you can use the provided `myarray` array to test the program with pre-defined integers.

## Running the Program

To compile and run the program, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `main.cpp` file.
3. Use a C++ compiler to compile the program. For example, with GCC:
4. Run the compiled executable:
5. Follow the prompts to input 5 integers.
6. The program will output the original array, followed by the sorted array using the Bubble Sort algorithm.
