# Merge Sort

This is a C++ program that implements the merge sort algorithm to sort an array of integers.

## Algorithm

The program uses the following steps to sort the array using the merge sort algorithm:

1. Divide the array into two halves recursively until each sub-array contains only one element.
2. Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

## Example

```plaintext
Enter 5 integers in any order:
5 2 8 1 3
Before Sorting:
5 2 8 1 3
After Sorting:
1 2 3 5 8
